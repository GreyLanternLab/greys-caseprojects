This checklist outlines the **categories, indicators and validation steps**
used during the fictional OSINT investigation.

## 🌐 Website & Domain

- [ ] WHOIS (registrar, registration date, privacy settings)
- [ ] DNS records (A / MX / TXT / SPF / DMARC)
- [ ] SSL / Certificate Transparency logs
- [ ] Wayback Machine or other archives (first capture, content changes)
- [ ] Technical fingerprint (CMS, site builder, trackers)
- [ ] Text comparison: does the advertisement text appear elsewhere?

**Notes:**

## 📧 Contact Points

- [ ] Email address — exact string search in search engines
- [ ] MX / SPF / DMARC records present?
- [ ] Phone number — country code, provider, VOIP or not
- [ ] Phone or email linked to other platforms?
- [ ] WhatsApp deeplink present or traces of use?

⚠️ **No contact via DM, WhatsApp or email. Passive checks only.**

## 📱 SOCMINT (Social Media Intelligence)

- [ ] Instagram / X / TikTok / Facebook: bio, links, age, activity
- [ ] Cross-platform overlap (same bio, text, imagery)
- [ ] Engagement ratio: followers vs likes/comments
- [ ] Screenshots or archive copies (without interaction)

## 🖼️ Image Analysis

- [ ] Reverse image search (photos and logo)
- [ ] Metadata / EXIF (if available)
- [ ] Stock images or commercial reuse detected?
- [ ] Geolocation checks (no private addresses)

⚠️ **No facial recognition on real individuals.**

## ✍️ Text & Language

- [ ] Exact sentence searches (“quoted”) in multiple languages
- [ ] Indicator analysis:
  - urgency / “immediate departure”
  - “accommodation provided”

## 🌍 Context & Corroboration

- [ ] Comparison with documented cases (UNODC, IOM, US TIP Reports)
- [ ] Timeline and node diagram of relationships (contact → domain → socials → mirrors)
- [ ] Strength of indicators documented:
  - [ ] weak
  - [ ] moderate
  - [ ] strong

## ⚖️ Ethical Constraints

- [ ] No social engineering or false profiles
- [ ] Open, publicly accessible sources only
- [ ] Findings framed as indicators or patterns, not accusations
- [ ] Data minimisation and proportionality applied
- [ ] Identities anonymised in reporting
